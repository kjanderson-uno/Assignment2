                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Lincoln, NE.  I went to Lincoln Southeast where I played soccer and basketball.
                    I played Basketball for 2 years.  The second and final year I played basketball, the team went
                    undefeated and we won the city tournament.  I have played soccer for my entire life and my
                    senior year I was named captain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Things I love to do include traveling, playing soccer, and playing video games.  My favorite place that
                    I have traveled so far had seen San Antonio and the San Antonio River Walk.  When I graduate, I plan on
                    traveling to Europe for a few weeks.  My favorite video games include FIFA and Rocket League.
                    I am excited to play Red Dead 2, FIFA 20, and NBA 2K20.

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    I have gone to traditional public school my entire life.  I have never been a huge education person in
                    the sense schooling, but I do love learning things on my own that include watching educational youtube
                    videos and reading educational books.

                    As told in my <i>About Me</i> section, I went to school in lincoln and I went to Lincoln Southeast.

                <h2>Recreation</h2>
                <p>
                    At UNO, I don't belong to many clubs or groups.  My time is mostly spent doing homework,
                    watching sports, playing soccer, and playing video games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most inclusive activity I get involved in at UNO is recreational sports.
                    I have played Indoor Soccer, Outdoor Soccer, and Basketball.
